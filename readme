# CFScanner Auto Installer & Manager

This repository provides an **interactive Bash menu** to install, configure, and manage [CFScanner](https://github.com/MortezaBashsiz/CFScanner) (Python version).  
It installs all dependencies, sets up a `systemd` service, and schedules the scanner to run periodically.
